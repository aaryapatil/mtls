# mtls
Code to implement the multitaper Lomb-Scargle spectrum estimator.

There is a source R package `LSspec_V.v.tar.gz` that can be installed on a linux computer (no support yet for Windows, sorry!).
An installation of [nfft](https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/) is required -- I recommend installing using your linux distribution's software manager.

There is an example of the mtls computed from some Kepler data in the `Examples` folder.
